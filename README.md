### By Sauda Habib
#### Description
This is a game in which two players take turn in rolling a die. The winner is declared when one player reaches 100 points before the other. A player can play for as many rounds as he wants unless he clicks the hold button or his die lands at the value(1) at which point the second player is prompted to play. The game calculates the cumulative scores of each player and alerts them when one reaches the winning point.
